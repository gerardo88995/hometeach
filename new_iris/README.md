# Iris Data Analysis

> 4 features & 3 categories in total
## `Features`：
* Sepal_length  
* sepal_width  
* petal_length  
* petal_width  
## `Categories`：
* Setosa 
* Versicolor
* Virginica

## `Insights` :
 1. The `length & width of the sepals` of the three species were captured through sql query, and the differences among the species are not obvious. The judgment is not a feature that can be used to distinguish the species.
 2. In the same operation, the difference in petal `length & width between species` is more obvious among groups. For example, the "average length" of petals between species is nearly 3 times different, and the upper and lower bounds of each other's length do not overlap. In this group of data, it is a judgment feature with a fairly high accuracy rate.
